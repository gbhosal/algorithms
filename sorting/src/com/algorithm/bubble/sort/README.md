# Bubble sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.


performBubbleSort() function always runs O(n^2) time even if the array is sorted. It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap.

# Sample result
Enter Integer values for sorting. enter "q" to finish. <br />
9 <br />
1 <br />
3 <br />
2 <br />
8 <br />
6 <br />
34 <br />
145 <br />
44 <br />
23 <br />
q <br />

Before sorting => [9, 1, 3, 2, 8, 6, 34, 145, 44, 23] <br />
After sorting => [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 23, 34, 44, 145]
